# Accelerate target discovery and hypothesis generation for new experiments

## Overview
Identifying novel treatment targets often leads to inefficient hypothesis selection and poor prioritization of experiments. AI-assisted target discovery helps to streamline the process of experimental validation, potentially helping to reduce development time costs. We demonstrate a hypothesis generation supervisor agent that is initialized at runtime as an inline agent with existing agent collaborators. 

## Multi-agent collaboration with inline supervisors workflow
Select from a list of agents in a catalog, define instructions for the supervisor at runtime and get started
